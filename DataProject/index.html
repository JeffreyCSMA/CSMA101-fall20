      <p>Here you see 4 years with each dot respresenting a day in that years. The color of said dot represents the air quality of that day. I find myself checking a lot. So it kinda just came to me that this should be my project. I used <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/california/los-angeles">IQAir</a> to update my data for 2020 as this year is still on going.For all of the rest of my data I used <a href ="https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/">Air Quality Historical Data Platform</a>. They mad it easy because they had the data downloadable as a CSV. But it was messy so i fixed it in Exel. I would say the hardest part was to use the data I added. I had trouble checking and filling in my circles with the quality of air. </p>
